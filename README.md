# Pac-Tools
## A solution for Windows tools

# Built over Batch files
We built our program on basic command-line file types for Windows only. Sorry, Mac users! 

# Pac-age Manager (see what I did there?)
Our package manager, a.k.a Pac-age, is the package manager you can use to download programs from the internet, or our Github hosted pre-installed packages that are free of
viruses.

# Easy-to-use interface
It's easy to use our program. Just read our GUIDE.md file, and you'll master Pac-Tools in an instant!
